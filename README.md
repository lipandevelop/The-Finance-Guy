Developed using Objective C, this is a mini-Game that allows iPhone users to understand advanced concepts of equity and derivatives trading using simple and interactive gesture recognitions in a game setting. Stocks are generated to mimic movements of real stocks based in a environment that simulates economic and business cycles, the stock's standard deviation, and management performance.

I aim to develop this game into a Role-Playing-Game with it's gameplay focused on lifestyle of a professional in the finance industry. I am targeting it's release on Apple Store in June of 2016.

The game is mostly developed using UIAnimations, Gesture Recognitions. Other programs such as Adobe's Creative Suite and Fruity Loops were used to develop the media of the application. I've also written the algorithm to generate the stocks.
